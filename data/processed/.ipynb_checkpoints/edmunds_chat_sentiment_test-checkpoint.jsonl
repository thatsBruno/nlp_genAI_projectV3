Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

I understand not all cars are going to be built and last forever. Some just don't work, but if the dealership you bought your car from is not fixing your car then don't hate the car hate your dealer. I have had nothing but great success with my car. I don't expect it to be all mighty i mean its not a Mercedes or an Audi! Is a crossover mid level SUV. Not the most expensive vehicle you can buy! It's great for getting groceries or hauling the big dog around!

Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.  Also the Alternator pulley was chattering so replaced that.  Overall I would say this car has needed more unscheduled maintenance than my Toyotas but far less than my Chevy Equinox.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road. It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested. Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue. Bigger is not always better. After 4 months and 5K miles, zero defects.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice.

For starters the engine is loud, really loud.  Almost to the point that I'm waiting for an explosion to happen when I hit 4000 rpm.  Fuel economy is great (considering I went from 16 mpg to 23) and the ride is quite comfortable.  The price, well I still think Nissan could have done better with the S type.  $19000 is a bit much for just about the same stuff you could get in a Sentra.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}
