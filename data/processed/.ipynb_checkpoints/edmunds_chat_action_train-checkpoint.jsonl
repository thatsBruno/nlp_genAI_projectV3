The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable (and I have the leather package), no adj. head rest(which also block visibility) & no seat adj in the back either. The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe - the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w/ a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility. No matter if you like how it drives or not, it is simply unsafe to drive.

Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

After 3 times not repaired ( writing this review while waiting in dealership) If not fixed this time want it replaced. we do like the vehicle, averages 27 MPG rides well, handles well on interstate(9455 miles).

This car is a great all around CUV that will grow on you.Forgot to mention that with winter tires and the capability to engage true 4WD this car is great in the snow.Did trade in the car for a Highlander Hybrid with larger towing capacity.I've been seeing a lot \"new\" Rogues which are better looking and seem a lot larger, more like what a Murano was in 2008Again you can't go wrong it's just a question of taste.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice.

So far, we are well pleased.  We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle, we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron.  I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25.4  It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over.  I love the exterior design.  It performs adequately for us.  I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting.

It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested. Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue. Bigger is not always better.

Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.

I could not duplicate the key problem for the dealer, but it was getting frustrating. I removed the battery in the controller and bent the 3 contacts up slightly at the folds, using a small pocket knife. It has improved 95% and contribute some to junk in my pocket. I improved my blind spots by installing small rectangular stick on mirrors to my side mirrors. I still look back when I pull out, but it does give you more visibility. I'm 6'2 and I have more leg room than most vehicles. It has rapid response in emergency conditions. For the money, a nice little ride.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

I have no real complaints about the car.  It has 9,000 miles and has only been back to the dealer to have a sunroof put in and for oil changes.  I do see other peoples concerns with the awkward shifting, but it isn't anything that really bothers me personally.  The fuel economy says 24, but if you don't drive hard, I easily have cleared 27-28 in the city.

Three major problem. 1. Free penetration of cold air through knobs and buttons due to bad sealing 2. Noisy in wet days due to same reason. But Nissan consider it as normal, which means it is their limitation in technology 3. Very bad rear side-view visibility. You'd be very careful when you try to change lane. There are much wider blind area than any other car due to very bad visibility. I almost hit other car several time in 3 months driving, which I have never experienced before with other cars in my 30 years of spotless driving history. So, not recommended for young drivers.

It is been very reliable and comfortable transportation. However as soon as the warranty expired the convertible top stopped working.

They said it was the wiring harness and the switch for the convertible top  and that they had to remove the top to fix it and it might not refit and I would have to buy a whole new one.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAsk for more details\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Ask for more details"}

In conversation I had brought up an auto start, the associate agreed but the dealer does not install auto start and of course would be an expense I would be responsible for.

The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well. I had owned a Chrysler product & went back to shop- Patriot, Compass, Liberty are all inferior products as is the Escape,Impreza,& 09Equinox.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

Decided to make the jump to a new car (and payment) but I don't drive all that much so didn't want to make a huge investment.  The Rogue gives me the SUV for a reasonable payment.  Handling and styling are great, have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more.  VERY satisifed overall.  Need to be a bit cautious on lane changes due to blind spots caused by small side windows towards the back - working on mirror adjustments and not changing lanes as much!

I zeroed in on it for a few reasons.  First, I had a budget and a reliable used car is what I was looking for.  The Rogue was a vehicle that I researched a few years ago.  I like its versatility as an SUV.  I like that it is not too big, not too small, cute looking, handles like a car, there are a few minor vibrations at higher speeds,  but all in all a great deal for the vehicle.  It was in terrific shape, brand new tires brand new front brakes and 7/10 on the rear brakes  with the exception of some scratches that came off with your typical scratch remover and one ding with minor rust that I have a $500 quote to repair (needs body work) and I am planning on keeping it for its second 100K miles.  My son uses it to go to work when home from college, but I'm finding that I'm using it when he's not home to do 70 mile round trip commutes, trips to the cape (250miles)  and even weekend warrior errands.  It has become my go to car when it is available and will be my husband's car during winter snow storms since his car is a RWD.  We had a Nissan xterra that lasted us 200K miles so I'm feeling pretty good about its prospects for reliability.  All in all a great car and a great deal.  It took some getting used to the larger blind spot and the clock is an electronic clock that is starting to fade a bit, but this is a great car despite those two minor issue.  I think I might need a muffler at some point in the future since the original has some rust, but again, I knew what I was getting into buying a car with 94K miles.  So far, no issues at all.  Update. Well I had an axel and fan replaced in August so I spent about 1600 on those repairs. Other than that the car is running good. We have about 103k miles on the car now.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}
