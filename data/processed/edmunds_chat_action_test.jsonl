It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road. It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested. Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue. Bigger is not always better. After 4 months and 5K miles, zero defects.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

I use this van for my business deliveries and personal use. Camping, road trips, etc. We dont have any children so I store most of the seats in my warehouse. I wanted the passenger van for the rear air conditioning. We drove our van from Florida to California for a Cross Country trip in 2014. We averaged about 18 mpg. We drove thru a lot of rain and It was a very comfortable and stable vehicle. The V8 Nissan Titan engine is a 500k mile engine. It has been tested many times by delivery and trucking companies. This is why Nissan gives you a 5 year or 100k mile bumper to bumper warranty. Many people are scared about driving this van because of its size. But with front and rear sonar sensors, large mirrors and the back up camera. It is easy to drive. The front and rear sensors also monitor the front and rear sides of the bumpers making it easier to park close to objects. Our Nissan NV is a Tow Monster. It pulls our 5000 pound travel trailer like its not even there. I have plenty of power to pass a vehicle if needed. The 5.6 liter engine produces 317 hp. I have owned Chevy and Ford vans and there were not very comfortable and had little cockpit room. The Nissan NV is the only vehicle made that has the engine forward like a pick up truck giving the driver plenty of room and comfort in the cockpit area. I dont have any negatives to say about my NV. This is a wide vehicle. The only modification I would like to see from Nissan is for them to add amber side mirror marker lights.BTW. I now own a 2016 Nissan NVP SL. Love it.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

Handling and styling are great, have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more.  VERY satisifed overall.

I zeroed in on it for a few reasons.  First, I had a budget and a reliable used car is what I was looking for.  The Rogue was a vehicle that I researched a few years ago.  I like its versatility as an SUV.  I like that it is not too big, not too small, cute looking, handles like a car, there are a few minor vibrations at higher speeds,  but all in all a great deal for the vehicle.  It was in terrific shape, brand new tires brand new front brakes and 7/10 on the rear brakes  with the exception of some scratches that came off with your typical scratch remover and one ding with minor rust that I have a $500 quote to repair (needs body work) and I am planning on keeping it for its second 100K miles.  My son uses it to go to work when home from college, but I'm finding that I'm using it when he's not home to do 70 mile round trip commutes, trips to the cape (250miles)  and even weekend warrior errands.  It has become my go to car when it is available and will be my husband's car during winter snow storms since his car is a RWD.  We had a Nissan xterra that lasted us 200K miles so I'm feeling pretty good about its prospects for reliability.  All in all a great car and a great deal.  It took some getting used to the larger blind spot and the clock is an electronic clock that is starting to fade a bit, but this is a great car despite those two minor issue.  I think I might need a muffler at some point in the future since the original has some rust, but again, I knew what I was getting into buying a car with 94K miles.  So far, no issues at all.  Update. Well I had an axel and fan replaced in August so I spent about 1600 on those repairs. Other than that the car is running good. We have about 103k miles on the car now.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

After 3 times not repaired ( writing this review while waiting in dealership) If not fixed this time want it replaced. we do like the vehicle, averages 27 MPG rides well, handles well on interstate(9455 miles).

So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan has started selling 12-passenger vans, at about the same price as the Ford and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV, we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles, we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van.
