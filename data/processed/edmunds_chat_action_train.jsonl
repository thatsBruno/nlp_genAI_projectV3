If you want good, safe performance  in the snow get a AWD vehicle that engages and stays engaged in AWD/ 4x4.It was new to me  so an expensive lesson!\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAsk for more details\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Ask for more details"}

I feel like I am in a sports car! Now I look for excuses to drive and I can because it uses a lot less gas than my Pathy.

The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well. I had owned a Chrysler product & went back to shop- Patriot, Compass, Liberty are all inferior products as is the Escape,Impreza,& 09Equinox.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.  Also the Alternator pulley was chattering so replaced that.  Overall I would say this car has needed more unscheduled maintenance than my Toyotas but far less than my Chevy Equinox.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

After test driving it, i was really glad i came to the Nissan dealer. It drove great, looked great, was extremely smooth and quite and the best part, was much cheaper than a similar crv/rav4. After owning a SL with premium package and sunroof, i am glad i purchased. We just love this vehicle, its smooth drive. It averages around 26 - 27 mpg. Great features.

This car is a great all around CUV that will grow on you.Forgot to mention that with winter tires and the capability to engage true 4WD this car is great in the snow.Did trade in the car for a Highlander Hybrid with larger towing capacity.I've been seeing a lot \"new\" Rogues which are better looking and seem a lot larger, more like what a Murano was in 2008Again you can't go wrong it's just a question of taste.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

I have test driven before the basic model hence why not excited to get this. The got me a fully loaded Rogue with leather and everything. The SL is such a difference. I live in the mountains so right off the dealership was from denver to Aspen. It handles great at low speeds and tightens up at higher. really fun with all the technology in there too.

The car is fun to drive. I'm getting used to the cvt tranny. I'm coming from a truck so it's a bit different but so far I really like it. The inside is very sporty gray and black. the Bose system is awesome if you love music and blue tooth on steering wheel is a great safety feature, I wish my wife had it in her car. I also drove the Santa fe and Tiguan. Santa Fe was boring but a lot bigger, Tiguan drove nice and had a lot of power for 4 cyl.They are a bit more money and less features though. Hope this helps anyone with making a decision. As note in other reviews there are some bad blind spots.

Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.  136K miles and getting a small rumble when first accelerating.  Sounds like a loose heat shield or exhaust item.  Hope it isn't the CVT failing which has been an issue on early production Rogues.  Otherwise still happy with the car.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

It is been very reliable and comfortable transportation. However as soon as the warranty expired the convertible top stopped working. The dealer laughed at me when they told me it would cost $13000 lto fix. I feel stuck with a car that has no trade-in value. They said it was the wiring harness and the switch for the convertible top  and that they had to remove the top to fix it and it might not refit and I would have to buy a whole new one.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAsk for more details\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Ask for more details"}

I was backing down my driveway at night and scraped the left rear wheel rim on a low stone wall because I couldn't judge distance properly due to the small rear window. Hope my gas mileage improves. Lowest has been 19.9 and highest is 21.6. Vehicle has less than 2000 miles on it, so I'm hoping for improvement as my mileage increases. Car drives and handles beautifully.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAsk for more details\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Ask for more details"}

People told me i had the best looking car they ever seen. I heard it all and then when i finally got rid of it then they started telling me the truth. I felt so bad because everyone was talking behind my back about this bubble that i'm driving. Not a good look for a middle age guy with a very important job. Not for nothing but i can't even put up a ceil fan to save my life yet drive this car. make sure you take a second  guess before u just go and buy this \"bubble\",they call it. Make sure it is the right car for u.

I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice. The sound system-- the factory version, not Bose--is still good quality.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Acknowledge and thank customer"}

The transmission was replaced under the extended CVT warranty. The transmission then failed a second time this year. Nissan was not helpful in resolving the issue, and asked me to pay $6,000 in repairs for the vehicle. It is not normal for a transmission to go bad after 2 or 3 years and a 7 year old vehicle to require 3 transmissions.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nEscalate to support team\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "Escalate to support team"}
