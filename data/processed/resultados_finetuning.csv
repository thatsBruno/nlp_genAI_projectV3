Great for being the wife's vehicle,"Overall this is a good family vehicle. Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2.5S had.  To me there's nothing fantastic but, I'm a sports car fanatic.  The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though.  Also does handle pretty decently for a tall vehicle.  Some of it's braking components and suspension aspects are shared with the Sentra SE- R Spec-V.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
BUY A ROGUE!,"Overall....BEST CAR EVER! I don't know what is wrong with people who fuss about the shape of the car, nothing is wrong with it! Rides like a dream, purrs like a kitten,and will never let you down unless it is a minor problem like an oil change or tires. BUY ONE!",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Acknowledge satisfaction
Nissan Rogue,"Took it to the mountains this summer, brakes buck and vibrate when braking going down hill. Very difficult to back up or change lanes due to back windows being too narrow to see out of. Makes whistling noise when going over 60 mph. Very annoying. Also, makes weird humming noise when slowing down. Recall on transmission. But they did extend my transmission warranty to 10 years or 120000 miles due to the recall. Otherwise, I do like my vehicle. It does drive very smooth and it handles well. Plus the bose stereo is awesome.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
My Fixes,"As far as smart key and rear window problems, this helped very much for me. I could not duplicate the key problem for the dealer, but it was getting frustrating. I removed the battery in the controller and bent the 3 contacts up slightly at the folds, using a small pocket knife. It has improved 95% and contribute some to junk in my pocket. I improved my blind spots by installing small rectangular stick on mirrors to my side mirrors. I still look back when I pull out, but it does give you more visibility. I'm 6'2 and I have more leg room than most vehicles. It has rapid response in emergency conditions. For the money, a nice little ride.",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Perfect Little Crossover,"I've only had this car for 6 months, but I'm pretty pleased with it. Great gas mileage, great breaking, and i love being high off the ground without the bigger size of a regular SUV. There is a blind spot from the back windows being tiny, so that's the one thing I would change. It could be better, but I love my rogue.",Positive,Positive,Acknowledge satisfaction,Appreciate feedback
Love It,"We leased an AWD SL and have had the vehicle for about two weeks.  So far, we are well pleased.  We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle, we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron.  I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25.4  It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over.  I love the exterior design.  It performs adequately for us.  I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting.  I'm well pleased with this vehicle thus far.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Fun car for the young,"This car isn't for older drivers. The backseat is very difficult to get into for passengers and the doors are heavy and of course, it sits high.You will also get some top and cowl rattle If you can get passed the above, then this is the car for you. Its funIt looks niceIt rides very nice.Life is good with the top down in this car.I have had mine for several thousand miles and love it!It rides great and the leather feels even better.It hasn't leaked a drop even in heavy rain.It's a lot of fun and the luxurious interior is a step up for me having come from Honda.The GPS isn't all that great but nice to have with thelarge touch screen",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
not a good car,Nissan Rogue 2009 it vibrates on reverse. Going 40 it has a whistle sound . The seats in the back make noise going backwards you can see there is  blank spots that your  can't  see,Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Just Purchased a new Rogue,"Have had my Sl Rogue for 2 weeks. The car is fun to drive. I'm getting used to the cvt tranny. I'm coming from a truck so it's a bit different but so far I really like it. The inside is very sporty gray and black. the Bose system is awesome if you love music and blue tooth on steering wheel is a great safety feature, I wish my wife had it in her car. I also drove the Santa fe and Tiguan. Santa Fe was boring but a lot bigger, Tiguan drove nice and had a lot of power for 4 cyl.They are a bit more money and less features though. Hope this helps anyone with making a decision. As note in other reviews there are some bad blind spots. That's my only negative so far in 2 weeks of ownership.",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Fun to drive!,"I have had this car nearly a month and all I can say is wow! I replaced my much loved Pathfinder with this and I could not be happier. Yes, I lose space and some off-road capability (which I did not use much anyway), but the handling is terrific. I feel like I am in a sports car! Now I look for excuses to drive and I can because it uses a lot less gas than my Pathy. I totally recommend this little crossover to anyone who needs utility with a great sporty ride. Buy it for the fun of it!",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Honest Review,"My Nissan Rogue is an excellent SUV AWD, the only issue I have is the backwindow is small, when looking through the rear window mirror, it is like looking through a porthole.You have to be extremely careful driving this car on the interstates, it is hard to see other cars and trucks when passing, and hard to back up since the view out the rearwindow is not good Otherwise I am very happy with my Rogue",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Acknowledge satisfaction
I'm Not Disappointed But ....,"I traded in an SUV and a hard top convertible in the hopes I would be able to have just one car that had the attributes of both.This does, for the most part.As others say, it's either love it or hate it.It clearly is a looker and folks either think its cool or ugly.It's definitely not a performance vehicle, but it doesn't claim to be.It's a very heavy vehicle and back seat access can be a pain, but the good seems to outweigh the bad, so far.It has memory seating so if you set your preferences, it will revert back with a touch of a button.The nav and leather upgraded interior is lovely and comfortable and to me, the only downside is that it requires premium petrol.",Neutral,Positive,Acknowledge satisfaction,Appreciate feedback
Rogue can compete with RAV and CRV,"As said above this car can easily compete with a RAV-4 or CRV.I drove my 09 Rogue SL AWD for 85,000 miles without a problem.As with everycar I own.owned I only use Mobil 1 for oil changes at longer intervals than book recommends for the car.Dealer did all my oil changes and maintenance and cost was overall less than expected.Just changed brakes and rotors all the way around with high quality as they old ones started to ""wobble"" at 83K miles.I averaged 24mpg with mixed driving.I had long highway drives (72 mph) at 29 mpg but also ones at 23 mpg.City driving is less than stated mpg, but overall a great comfy ride. This car is a great all around CUV that will grow on you.Forgot to mention that with winter tires and the capability to engage true 4WD this car is great in the snow.Did trade in the car for a Highlander Hybrid with larger towing capacity.I've been seeing a lot ""new"" Rogues which are better looking and seem a lot larger, more like what a Murano was in 2008Again you can't go wrong it's just a question of taste.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Don't buy,"First, our car has 55K miles. I know how this car performs and I do my own maintenance.  This review is based on 2 1600 mile trips, two weeks apart.  Received a recall letter from Nissan relative to Trans belt noise. We had no problem but took it in and had the new software installed. Our gas mileage went from 27-32 down to 20-24 MPG. Nissan refused to fix it. I will paint large lemons on it drive to every Nissan dealer I can find.  Paint quality is also pathetic.",Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Open support ticket
2 Bad Transmissions on the car,"The Rogue was great when I first bought it, until the transmission failed on the highway in 2013. The transmission was replaced under the extended CVT warranty. The transmission then failed a second time this year. Nissan was not helpful in resolving the issue, and asked me to pay $6,000 in repairs for the vehicle. It is not normal for a transmission to go bad after 2 or 3 years and a 7 year old vehicle to require 3 transmissions.",Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Apologize for inconvenience
Best in Show!,"There is no perfect small suv/crossover. The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well. I had owned a Chrysler product & went back to shop- Patriot, Compass, Liberty are all inferior products as is the Escape,Impreza,& 09Equinox.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Beware of Transmission,Love the car but only had it 4 months and it needs a transmission. Read the blogs and don't trust the dealerships. We've been driving Nissans for 15 years and can't believe what a Lemon the Rogue has turned into.,Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Won't recommend this car to anyone,"After 3 months, noticed transmission noise. Dealer told the noise was normal. Later, car was always stack in PARK position. To drive it, I had to manually unlock the transmission. Dealer replaced the Brack switch, Solenoide and other parts. It took me 4 months to get it fixed. Also, they fixed 3 recalls at the same time. This car is a total waist of $$. Also, rear vision is extremely dangerous. Do not consider this car at all. Nissan needs to review the design of the transmission COMPLETELY. Forgot to mention that I had also to replace the Door mechanism: wet stack in close position in cold weather...",Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Acknowledge satisfaction
it is just okay,"I have had this car about 9 months now.  I should have bought a used luxury for the price.  If you have a family larger than 4 forget about space in the hatch, there is no room.  Makes a lot of noise on the express way.  Not fun to drive in winds at high speeds.  Handles like a gem in the snow and ice.",Negative,Negative,Apologize for inconvenience,Appreciate feedback
Great 2 years!,"We have owned our Rogue for a little over 2 years with about 28,000 miles and have only had to have one thing fixed by warranty. Climate control dials that are supposed to light up during the night went out. Very happy with our purchase!",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Good Crossover,"The SL comes with some great amenities, great Bose sound system, hands free calling.  Comfortable ride, pulls small boat trailer fine, fun to use steering paddle ""shifters"", not bad mileage, shoulder belt height adjustment to low, HVAC controls indicating lamps (yellow) not bright enough or need different color in sharp daylight.  Overall a good SUV.",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
car is ok,"I have driven the car for 4 months, traded in a ford truck. I drive 6 miles each way to work, and my driving is 1/2 highway and 1/2 city. I'm a decent driver, and my mileage is only 19-22mpg, at the most.  The headrest is uncomfortable, otherwise the car is satisfactory. I feel very uncomfortable with the blind spots-the right triangler window and the rear window-are starting to feel like they are safety hazards. I regret having purchased the car because of the blind spots.",Neutral,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Surprised,"Much to my surprise..... I purchased as a surprise for my wife. She had seen one and loved it, the look of it anyway.... TOP DOWN is exceptional! comfortable, firm, solid and actually luxurious for a Nissan. Top up, different story. BLIND SPOTS are very bad! Poor design on the rear window. To remedy this I added magnifier mirrors on both sides to help correct the blind side problem. My wife LOVES her car and it is the only one she drives! (she has choices)",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
"Make the ""wobbling"" stop!!!!","I just bought a used 2009 Rogue less than a month ago and have had nothing but problems.The car was supposed to be ""certified"" as well.It has been at the dealer shop longer than I have actually been able to drive it.There were 6 issues with it, all have supposedly been resolved, except for one...the wobbling while driving 30-45 mph!Today I drove with the service manager, he informed me that it was normal and it was the torque conversion being engaged.I just can't buy that answer!It's annoying!He also said he has told over 600 people the same answer because they come in with the same complaint.Does anyone else have this issue???? I can't find ANYONE online complaining about it",Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Open support ticket
Not bad but terrible sealing,"Overall performances are acceptable. Three major problem. 1. Free penetration of cold air through knobs and buttons due to bad sealing 2. Noisy in wet days due to same reason. But Nissan consider it as normal, which means it is their limitation in technology 3. Very bad rear side-view visibility. You'd be very careful when you try to change lane. There are much wider blind area than any other car due to very bad visibility. I almost hit other car several time in 3 months driving, which I have never experienced before with other cars in my 30 years of spotless driving history. So, not recommended for young drivers.  Minor comment is bad front cup holder design  Overall: Not recommended",Negative,Negative,Appreciate feedback,Acknowledge satisfaction
Watch Out from Behind,"I bought my 2009 Rogue S used with 14K miles on it. I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice. The sound system-- the factory version, not Bose--is still good quality.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Acknowledge satisfaction
So Glad I Purchased It!,"As some reviewers have commented across other websites, you either love this car or hate it. After driving it for some 6 months and 12,000 miles, and having made multiple 400 mile trips through both snow and through 100F heat, I absolutely love this car! There are not many AWD convertibles out there, and while it was never meant to be a sports car, this crossover has been everything I could have wanted in an AWD convertible for taking long trips over mountains. The build quality is excellent and I have not experienced any of the difficulties (handling, door weight, etc.) noted in other reviews I read before purchasing. And get used to compliments from truckers and teenagers. It's non stop!",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Giving it back -> lemon,"I'm returning my car on 06/01. Dealer finally settled with me on a lemon case. I had issue with the fuel gauge. It will show half tank when its actually almost empty. I went to dealer ship 5 times. Replaced sensors twice and twice I was treated like crazy. + recalls.  I got so tired of owning not reliable car. I agree with previous postings, the car is good overall, but has too many blind spots. I've managed to handle that issue well, but Nissan needs some improvement in design of the back window. Also, MPG went down to around 20 in the city. oh, well it was hard for me to check as I think I never got accurate reading from the computer. I would not buy this car again.",Neutral,Neutral,Apologize for inconvenience,Appreciate feedback
Could be better.  Rogue S,"Drives like a car, smooth drive and just fun to drive.  Great buy for your money.",Positive,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
Very Reliable.,"We have owned the Rogue for almost a year and have 12200 miles on it. We have not been in the dealer once except for the regular scheduled  maintenance and 3 recalls but all were done at once and during a regular visit so it wasn't a pain at all. This car is very reliable the AWD is great and handles well in snow or rain the ride is pretty comfortable, we take lots of road trips our longest trip was about 450 miles round trip and no problems at all, more room would be nice but it is a crossover. We are very happy with this car.",Neutral,Positive,Appreciate feedback,Appreciate feedback
