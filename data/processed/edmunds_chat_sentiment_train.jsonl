I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice.

It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well.

It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.  136K miles and getting a small rumble when first accelerating.  Sounds like a loose heat shield or exhaust item.  Hope it isn't the CVT failing which has been an issue on early production Rogues.

Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.  Also the Alternator pulley was chattering so replaced that.  Overall I would say this car has needed more unscheduled maintenance than my Toyotas but far less than my Chevy Equinox.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

I use this van for my business deliveries and personal use. Camping, road trips, etc. We dont have any children so I store most of the seats in my warehouse. I wanted the passenger van for the rear air conditioning. We drove our van from Florida to California for a Cross Country trip in 2014. We averaged about 18 mpg. We drove thru a lot of rain and It was a very comfortable and stable vehicle. The V8 Nissan Titan engine is a 500k mile engine. It has been tested many times by delivery and trucking companies. This is why Nissan gives you a 5 year or 100k mile bumper to bumper warranty. Many people are scared about driving this van because of its size. But with front and rear sonar sensors, large mirrors and the back up camera. It is easy to drive. The front and rear sensors also monitor the front and rear sides of the bumpers making it easier to park close to objects. Our Nissan NV is a Tow Monster. It pulls our 5000 pound travel trailer like its not even there. I have plenty of power to pass a vehicle if needed. The 5.6 liter engine produces 317 hp. I have owned Chevy and Ford vans and there were not very comfortable and had little cockpit room. The Nissan NV is the only vehicle made that has the engine forward like a pick up truck giving the driver plenty of room and comfort in the cockpit area. I dont have any negatives to say about my NV. This is a wide vehicle. The only modification I would like to see from Nissan is for them to add amber side mirror marker lights.BTW. I now own a 2016 Nissan NVP SL. Love it.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

The thought of diving a huge 12-passenger van did not appeal to us. The choices for a long time have pretty much been either Ford or Chevy, which have limited features, and the Mercedes van, while nice, is just too expensive. So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan has started selling 12-passenger vans, at about the same price as the Ford and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV, we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles, we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van.

It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested.

About 12Km now and no complaints other than gas mileage not quite as good as I expected it to be.  Its versatile and fund to drive both in the city and on the highway.  Always admired the looks of the Merano, this shares many of those good looks and makes RAV 4 and CRV look dated.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

Fun to drive-- a tall man's sports car. Fun to drive,  gets plenty of great, positive comments. Best vehicle I have owned.

Great gas mileage, great breaking, and i love being high off the ground without the bigger size of a regular SUV. There is a blind spot from the back windows being tiny, so that's the one thing I would change. It could be better, but I love my rogue.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\npositive\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "positive"}

If you want good, safe performance  in the snow get a AWD vehicle that engages and stays engaged in AWD/ 4x4.It was new to me  so an expensive lesson!\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nneutral\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "neutral"}

I drive 6 miles each way to work, and my driving is 1/2 highway and 1/2 city. I'm a decent driver, and my mileage is only 19-22mpg, at the most.  The headrest is uncomfortable, otherwise the car is satisfactory. I feel very uncomfortable with the blind spots-the right triangler window and the rear window-are starting to feel like they are safety hazards. I regret having purchased the car because of the blind spots.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nneutral\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "neutral"}

I know how this car performs and I do my own maintenance.  This review is based on 2 1600 mile trips, two weeks apart.  Received a recall letter from Nissan relative to Trans belt noise. We had no problem but took it in and had the new software installed. Our gas mileage went from 27-32 down to 20-24 MPG. Nissan refused to fix it. I will paint large lemons on it drive to every Nissan dealer I can find.  Paint quality is also pathetic.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nneutral\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "neutral"}

Here are the pros:* smooth drive*comfortable driver configurations (however the shift stick gets in the way of adjusting the ac.)* handles the road well* great warranty* people move out of your way and let you into the laneCons:* very wide turn which make it difficult to maneuver in shopping parking lots and carpool lanes at school* Ac has no power in the back since it is such a long run from the front* seats are poorly designed so car seats do not sit well and safely* they claim you can configure the seats in so many ways, but you can't and are limited to a few* essentially it is a truck with seats inside - *the cup holders are on the floor and there is no storage pockets or space so things fly all over the place, *the floors are uneven since they just put down padding in between the runners but once you use the van for a few month the padding starts to cave, * there are not enough car seat anchors so you are limited where you can put them, * the lights are poorly placed, * there is no rear controls for the ac only by the driver, *the seats don't move or recline at all.* there should be a second sliding door for easier access* the v8 drinks gas , I get only about 7-8 miles a gallon (I only have 4k miles on the van)* It is a very high step to get in and out and my little kids keep falling out of the vanThere needs to be a mom involved when they update this van or it won't sell well.\nSentiment:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nneutral\n<|eot_id|>", "label": "neutral"}
