There are not many AWD convertibles out there, and while it was never meant to be a sports car, this crossover has been everything I could have wanted in an AWD convertible for taking long trips over mountains. The build quality is excellent and I have not experienced any of the difficulties (handling, door weight, etc.) noted in other reviews I read before purchasing.

It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.  136K miles and getting a small rumble when first accelerating.  Sounds like a loose heat shield or exhaust item.  Hope it isn't the CVT failing which has been an issue on early production Rogues.  Otherwise still happy with the car.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>",

I use this van for my business deliveries and personal use. Camping, road trips, etc. We dont have any children so I store most of the seats in my warehouse. I wanted the passenger van for the rear air conditioning. We drove our van from Florida to California for a Cross Country trip in 2014. We averaged about 18 mpg. We drove thru a lot of rain and It was a very comfortable and stable vehicle. The V8 Nissan Titan engine is a 500k mile engine. It has been tested many times by delivery and trucking companies. This is why Nissan gives you a 5 year or 100k mile bumper to bumper warranty. Many people are scared about driving this van because of its size. But with front and rear sonar sensors, large mirrors and the back up camera. It is easy to drive. The front and rear sensors also monitor the front and rear sides of the bumpers making it easier to park close to objects. Our Nissan NV is a Tow Monster. It pulls our 5000 pound travel trailer like its not even there. I have plenty of power to pass a vehicle if needed. The 5.6 liter engine produces 317 hp. I have owned Chevy and Ford vans and there were not very comfortable and had little cockpit room. The Nissan NV is the only vehicle made that has the engine forward like a pick up truck giving the driver plenty of room and comfort in the cockpit area. I dont have any negatives to say about my NV. This is a wide vehicle. The only modification I would like to see from Nissan is for them to add amber side mirror marker lights.BTW. I now own a 2016 Nissan NVP SL.

Stumbled upon the Rougue and found it to be every bit as good as a CRV which I previously owned and better than the Toyota.  Toyota and Honda would not deal but Nissan came down $6K off the list last August and that clinched the deal.  About 12Km now and no complaints other than gas mileage not quite as good as I expected it to be.  Its versatile and fund to drive both in the city and on the highway.  Always admired the looks of the Merano, this shares many of those good looks and makes RAV 4 and CRV look dated.\nAction:\n<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\nAcknowledge and thank customer\n<|eot_id|>",

That small orange, round shaped computer screen is annoying after a week of looking at it, it's so cheap and like an alien to the rest of dashboard. Suspension is weak to my taste. Lots of road noise when on poor pavement. With high speed and gusty winds vehicle behaves strange least. When you close your door it sounds like something loose inside.
