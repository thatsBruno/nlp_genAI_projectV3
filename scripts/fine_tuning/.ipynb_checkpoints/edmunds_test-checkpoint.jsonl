This car has many blindspots!  No pickup whatsoever!!!Takes forever for the car to get warm/cold!  Sounds like an angry mosquito when you accelerate!  I tell the kids to \"lean foward\" when I am getting onto the highway...Already have had 2 serious recalls.  Now I have an \"service engine soon\" light that won't go off.  I am sure it's a gas cap issue, but I can't take a day off to waste waiting around at the dealership!

There are not many AWD convertibles out there, and while it was never meant to be a sports car, this crossover has been everything I could have wanted in an AWD convertible for taking long trips over mountains. The build quality is excellent and I have not experienced any of the difficulties (handling, door weight, etc.) noted in other reviews I read before purchasing.

Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2.5S had.  To me there's nothing fantastic but, I'm a sports car fanatic.  The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though.

Very difficult to back up or change lanes due to back windows being too narrow to see out of. Makes whistling noise when going over 60 mph. Very annoying. Also, makes weird humming noise when slowing down. Recall on transmission. But they did extend my transmission warranty to 10 years or 120000 miles due to the recall. Otherwise, I do like my vehicle.

The car is fun to drive. I'm getting used to the cvt tranny. I'm coming from a truck so it's a bit different but so far I really like it. The inside is very sporty gray and black. the Bose system is awesome if you love music and blue tooth on steering wheel is a great safety feature, I wish my wife had it in her car. I also drove the Santa fe and Tiguan. Santa Fe was boring but a lot bigger, Tiguan drove nice and had a lot of power for 4 cyl.They are a bit more money and less features though. Hope this helps anyone with making a decision. As note in other reviews there are some bad blind spots.

The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well.

It was very well cared for with 95,000 miles.  New brakes, tires, and all scheduled maintenance was done.  We have had no problems (ex a torn axle boot) in 2 years and 22,000 miles.  This is our favorite car (we have 4) as it has a great balance of economy, handling, comfort, and build quality.  The interior is quieter and classier than the CRV or RAV 4.  Plenty of room to move the kids in and out of college.  When I drive the car I average around 27 mpg both city and highway, not bad for an AWD SUV.  The handling/ride combination is good.  The car is quite nimble compared to by 2003 Lexus RX 300.  Ours has all options but for NAV so there is little lacking.  We will consider another used Rogue when one of our other cars needs replaced.  Living in New England the AWD is a must.  I would personally prefer to drive a car over most SUV's but not this Rogue.  I honestly like the car that much.  As of October 2016 now have 131K miles on the car and all is well.  No problems and still drives well.  136K miles and getting a small rumble when first accelerating.  Sounds like a loose heat shield or exhaust item.  Hope it isn't the CVT failing which has been an issue on early production Rogues.  Otherwise still happy with the car.\nRating: 5.0\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}
