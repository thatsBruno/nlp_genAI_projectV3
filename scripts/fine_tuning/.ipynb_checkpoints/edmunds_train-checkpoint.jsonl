So far, we are well pleased.  We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle, we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron.  I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25.4  It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over.  I love the exterior design.  It performs adequately for us.  I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting.  I'm well pleased with this vehicle thus far.\nRating: 4.5\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

The one we have now also has had electrical problems with the keyless system. The selling dealer has been great but nissan has dropped trhe ball. After 3 times not repaired ( writing this review while waiting in dealership) If not fixed this time want it replaced. we do like the vehicle, averages 27 MPG rides well, handles well on interstate(9455 miles). But will probably not buy another due to 2 for 2 having electrical issues. Like the sound system not so happy with CVT (had a 2007 Maxima with CVT didn't like the trans).\nRating: 3.5\nSentiment: Negative\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOpen support ticket<|eot_id|>"}

Dealer told the noise was normal. Later, car was always stack in PARK position. To drive it, I had to manually unlock the transmission. Dealer replaced the Brack switch, Solenoide and other parts. It took me 4 months to get it fixed. Also, they fixed 3 recalls at the same time. This car is a total waist of $$. Also, rear vision is extremely dangerous. Do not consider this car at all.

I use this van for my business deliveries and personal use. Camping, road trips, etc. We dont have any children so I store most of the seats in my warehouse. I wanted the passenger van for the rear air conditioning. We drove our van from Florida to California for a Cross Country trip in 2014. We averaged about 18 mpg. We drove thru a lot of rain and It was a very comfortable and stable vehicle. The V8 Nissan Titan engine is a 500k mile engine. It has been tested many times by delivery and trucking companies. This is why Nissan gives you a 5 year or 100k mile bumper to bumper warranty. Many people are scared about driving this van because of its size. But with front and rear sonar sensors, large mirrors and the back up camera. It is easy to drive. The front and rear sensors also monitor the front and rear sides of the bumpers making it easier to park close to objects. Our Nissan NV is a Tow Monster. It pulls our 5000 pound travel trailer like its not even there. I have plenty of power to pass a vehicle if needed. The 5.6 liter engine produces 317 hp. I have owned Chevy and Ford vans and there were not very comfortable and had little cockpit room. The Nissan NV is the only vehicle made that has the engine forward like a pick up truck giving the driver plenty of room and comfort in the cockpit area. I dont have any negatives to say about my NV. This is a wide vehicle. The only modification I would like to see from Nissan is for them to add amber side mirror marker lights.BTW. I now own a 2016 Nissan NVP SL.

Fuel economy is great (considering I went from 16 mpg to 23) and the ride is quite comfortable.

I zeroed in on it for a few reasons.  First, I had a budget and a reliable used car is what I was looking for.  The Rogue was a vehicle that I researched a few years ago.  I like its versatility as an SUV.  I like that it is not too big, not too small, cute looking, handles like a car, there are a few minor vibrations at higher speeds,  but all in all a great deal for the vehicle.  It was in terrific shape, brand new tires brand new front brakes and 7/10 on the rear brakes  with the exception of some scratches that came off with your typical scratch remover and one ding with minor rust that I have a $500 quote to repair (needs body work) and I am planning on keeping it for its second 100K miles.  My son uses it to go to work when home from college, but I'm finding that I'm using it when he's not home to do 70 mile round trip commutes, trips to the cape (250miles)  and even weekend warrior errands.  It has become my go to car when it is available and will be my husband's car during winter snow storms since his car is a RWD.  We had a Nissan xterra that lasted us 200K miles so I'm feeling pretty good about its prospects for reliability.  All in all a great car and a great deal.  It took some getting used to the larger blind spot and the clock is an electronic clock that is starting to fade a bit, but this is a great car despite those two minor issue.  I think I might need a muffler at some point in the future since the original has some rust, but again, I knew what I was getting into buying a car with 94K miles.  So far, no issues at all.  Update. Well I had an axel and fan replaced in August so I spent about 1600 on those repairs. Other than that the car is running good. We have about 103k miles on the car now.\nRating: 4.0\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppreciate feedback<|eot_id|>"}

I understand not all cars are going to be built and last forever. Some just don't work, but if the dealership you bought your car from is not fixing your car then don't hate the car hate your dealer. I have had nothing but great success with my car. I don't expect it to be all mighty i mean its not a Mercedes or an Audi! Is a crossover mid level SUV. Not the most expensive vehicle you can buy! It's great for getting groceries or hauling the big dog around! Its the best buy in its class in my opinion with the look and feel of all other crossovers.\nRating: 4.625\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

I had researched it & heard about the rear view issues, but WOW! It is bad. The blind spot on each back corner is a complete design flaw and must be fixed with larger windows in new versions. It's not so much the back window as it is the 2 small side windows. It's a real danger if you ask me, but the rest of the car is fine. I had an 07 Honda CR-V before this one and they're comparable. I don't mind the CVT transmission and feel the car accelerates better than my CR-V did. I have had no issues in these first few months. Gas mileage is great.  AC is COLD, which is nice. The sound system-- the factory version, not Bose--is still good quality.\nRating: 4.125\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppreciate feedback<|eot_id|>"}

Stumbled upon the Rougue and found it to be every bit as good as a CRV which I previously owned and better than the Toyota.  Toyota and Honda would not deal but Nissan came down $6K off the list last August and that clinched the deal.  About 12Km now and no complaints other than gas mileage not quite as good as I expected it to be.  Its versatile and fund to drive both in the city and on the highway.

This car is a great all around CUV that will grow on you.Forgot to mention that with winter tires and the capability to engage true 4WD this car is great in the snow.Did trade in the car for a Highlander Hybrid with larger towing capacity.I've been seeing a lot \"new\" Rogues which are better looking and seem a lot larger, more like what a Murano was in 2008Again you can't go wrong it's just a question of taste.\nRating: 4.0\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable (and I have the leather package), no adj. head rest(which also block visibility) & no seat adj in the back either. The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe - the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w/ a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility.

I agree with previous postings, the car is good overall, but has too many blind spots. I've managed to handle that issue well, but Nissan needs some improvement in design of the back window. Also, MPG went down to around 20 in the city. oh, well it was hard for me to check as I think I never got accurate reading from the computer.

I removed the battery in the controller and bent the 3 contacts up slightly at the folds, using a small pocket knife. It has improved 95% and contribute some to junk in my pocket.

Or the fact that they think the car is a 4X4. Nissan/Infiniti AWD is one of the best in the world and as a long time Infiniti owner of the M class X series I love there AWD and I live in snow country.We purchased this for my fiance as a baby is on the way and wanted a great MPG Cross over.We look at the Infiniti Cross over but my Fiance didn't like any of the looks and felt it had to many gadgets. So we went with the SL AWD Rogue and she loves it! Great MPG love the CVT tranny fun on highway and holds well in the snow for the high RMPS.\nRating: 4.5\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

The windows freeze and do not drop when opening and closing the doors. Therefore I need to start my car for at least 20 minutes in order to close my doors correctly. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and unfortunately I was told there was noting they could do. In conversation I had brought up an auto start, the associate agreed but the dealer does not install auto start and of course would be an expense I would be responsible for. So needless to say I am not happy with my purchase in regards to this issue.\nRating: 3.5\nSentiment: Negative\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOpen support ticket<|eot_id|>"}

Within a couple months of driving the trans started making a chattering noise. Dealership replaced the trans. Now they need it for about 3 hours for various recall issues. The Bose stereo sounds like all the sound is focused on front center speaker. The headrest is uncomfortable, and doesn't stay down, always slides back up. The sideview mirrors whistle at higher speeds and gusts of wind. Gas mileage isn't great, but hilly area with 65+ speed limits accounts for that.  On positive note, it rides smooth, accelerates nicely, looks great, handles like a pro, great in inclement weather.\nRating: 4.0\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

The thought of diving a huge 12-passenger van did not appeal to us. The choices for a long time have pretty much been either Ford or Chevy, which have limited features, and the Mercedes van, while nice, is just too expensive. So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan has started selling 12-passenger vans, at about the same price as the Ford and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV, we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles, we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van. I highly recommend the NV.\nRating: 4.125\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

We live in Anchorage Alaska where we normally have beautiful summers that are perfect for top down weather and cold winters.The convertible top on this car keepsout the cold weather in the winter plus the AWD is just what the doctor ordered for up here. A few times we would have the drivers window freeze and stick to the top if they had gotten wet. Other wise everthing else worked with no problems.We now own 2 of them, the 2011 is now mine and my wife has a new 2014 model!\nRating: 4.875\nSentiment: Positive\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAcknowledge satisfaction<|eot_id|>"}

Update 8/22/2018.  Car now has 147,000 miles.  Still generally happy.  Did have to recently spend $1,500 in repairs.  Oil cooler on CVT was leaking so needed replaced.  Thankfully the dealer said the CVT itself is in good shape.  Also had the belt tensioner pulley replaced.   I suppose it isn't unreasonable to put this kind of $ in a car at 140K miles.  Also the Alternator pulley was chattering so replaced that.  Overall I would say this car has needed more unscheduled maintenance than my Toyotas but far less than my Chevy Equinox.\nRating: 4.0\nSentiment: Neutral\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppreciate feedback<|eot_id|>"}

I should have bought a used luxury for the price.  If you have a family larger than 4 forget about space in the hatch, there is no room.  Makes a lot of noise on the express way.  Not fun to drive in winds at high speeds.  Handles like a gem in the snow and ice.\nRating: 3.75\nSentiment: Neutral\n\nWhat should be the correct response?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAppreciate feedback<|eot_id|>"}
